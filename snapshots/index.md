# Testing with Snapshots

As of version 11, tap supports saving and then comparing against
"snapshot" strings.  This is a powerful technique for testing programs
that generate output, but it comes with some caveats.

## Basics of Output Testing

Consider a test program like this:

```javascript
module.exports = function (tag, contents) {
  return '<' + tag + '>' + contents + '</' + tag + '>'
}
```

We might have a test like this:

```javascript
const t = require('tap')
const tagger = require('./index.js')
t.equal(tagger('tagName', 'content'), '<tagName>content</tagName>')
```

This is good for a couple of reasons:

1. It's clear reading our test what the expected output is.
2. We're unlikely to create a test without thinking carefully about
   what _exactly_ it's testing.

However, managing strings like this can become extremely tedious,
especially in cases where the output is long, or there are many cases
to test.  If we make an _intentional_ change to the output, then we
need to manually update a large number of large strings, scattered
throughout the test suite.  The inevitable result is that we either
make the tests less comprehensive, or even worse, treat some as "known
failures".

## Testing Output with Snapshots

We could also write our test file like this:

```javascript
const t = require('tap')
const tagger = require('./index.js')
t.matchSnapshot(tagger('tagName', 'content'), 'output')
```

But wait, where is the expected output?

To create the snapshot file, we run this command:

```
$ TAP_SNAPSHOT=1 tap test.js
test.js ............................................... 1/1
total ................................................. 1/1

  1 passing (207.826ms)

  ok
```

By setting `TAP_SNAPSHOT` in the environment, we tell tap to write the
output to a special file, and treat the assertion as automatically
passing.

The generated file is designed to be human-readable, but you should
not edit it directly.

    $ cat tap-snapshots/test.js-TAP.test.js
    /* IMPORTANT
     * This snapshot file is auto-generated, but designed for humans.
     * It should be checked into source control and tracked carefully.
     * Re-generate by setting TAP_SNAPSHOT=1 and running tests.
     * Make sure to inspect the output below.  Do not ignore changes!
     */
    'use strict'
    exports[`test.js TAP > output 1`] = `
    <tagName>content</tagName>

The filename is derived from the name of the test file.  The headings
of each string output are based on the names of your tests and
assertions, and given a numeric index to handle collisions.

## Snapshotting non-Strings

If the argument passed to `t.matchSnapshot()` isn't a string, then it
will be converted to a string using Node.js's `util.inspect`.  This is
typically pretty easy for humans to understand, but of course if you
prefer to use `JSON.stringify` or something else, you can do so easily
enough.

## Caveats

### Track Changes

**Important: you should check the snapshot file into source control!**

When there are changes to it, inspect the diff and make sure that
nothing unexpected happened to change your output.

If you don't check this file into source control, then a significant
part of your test is not checked in.  This prevents people from
collaborating on your project.

If you accept changes to it without care, then you can obscure
unintended changes.  (Though, even if this happens, `git bisect` can
track down the source of the change quite quickly, so it's not the end
of the world if there are occasional mistakes.)

### Strip Variables from Output

If your output includes data that is known to change from one run to
the next, then these changes should be stripped before matching
against a snapshot.

This includes process IDs, time stamps, and many other system details.

Consider this function:

```javascript
function msgTime (msg) {
  return msg + ' time=' + Date.now()
}
```

Since the output will obviously be slightly different every time the
function is tested, we need to strip out the time value.

```javascript
const t = require('tap')

function clean (output) {
  return output.replace(/ time=[0-9]+$/g, ' time={time}')
}

const output = msgTime('this is a test')
t.matchSnapshot(clean(output), 'add timestamp to message')
```

When run with `TAP_SNAPSHOT=1`, it generates this snapshot file:

```javascript
exports[`test.js TAP > add timestamp to message 1`] = `
this is a test time={time}
`
```
