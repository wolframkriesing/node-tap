## tap = require('tap')

The root `tap` object is an instance of the Test class with a few
slight modifications.

1. By default, it pipes to stdout, so running a test directly just
   dumps the TAP data for inspection.  This piping behavior is a
   _little_ bit magic -- it only pipes when you do something that
   triggers output, so there's no need to manually unpipe if you never
   actually use it to run tests.
2. Various other things are hung onto it for convenience, since it is
   the main package export.
3. The test ends automatically when `process.on('exit')` fires, so
   there is no need to call `tap.end()` explicitly.
4. Adding a `tearDown` function triggers `autoend` behavior.
   Otherwise, the `end` would potentially never arrive, if for example
   `tearDown` is used to close a server or cancel some long-running
   process, because `process.on('exit')` would never fire of its own
   accord.

## tap.Test

The `Test` class is the main thing you'll be touching when you use
this module.

The most common way to instantiate a `Test` object by calling the
`test` method on the root or any other `Test` object.  The callback
passed to `test(name, fn)` will receive a child `Test` object as its
argument.

A `Test` object is a Readable Stream.  Child tests automatically send
their data to their parent, and the root `require('tap')` object pipes
to stdout by default.  However, you can instantiate a `Test` object
and then pipe it wherever you like.  The only limit is your imagination.

Whenever you see `t.<whatever>` in this documentation, it refers to a
Test object, but applies equally well in most cases to the root test.

### t.test([name], [options], [function])

Create a subtest.  Returns a [Promise](/promises/) which resolves with
the parent when the child test is completed.

If the function is omitted, then it will be marked as a "todo" or
"pending" test.

If the function has a name, and no name is provided, then the function
name will be used as the test name.  If no test name is provided, then
the name will be `(unnamed test)`.

The function gets a Test object as its only argument.  From there, you
can call the `t.end()` method on that object to end the test, or use
the `t.plan()` method to specify how many child tests or
[asserts](/asserts/) the test will have.

If the function returns a [Promise](/promises/) object (that is, an
object with a `then` method), then when the promise is rejected or
fulfilled, the test will be either ended or failed.  Note that this
means that an `async` function will automatically end when it's done,
because of the implicit promise.

If the function is not provided, then this will be treated as a `todo`
test.

The options object is the same as would be passed to [any
assert](/asserts/), with some additional fields that are only relevant
for child tests:

* `todo` Set to boolean `true` or a String to mark this as pending.
  (Note that this is always the case if no function is provided.)
* `skip` Set to boolean `true` or a String to mark this as skipped.
* `timeout`: The number of ms to allow the test to run.
* `bail`: Set to `true` to bail out on the first test failure.
* `autoend`: Automatically `end()` the test on the next turn of the
  event loop after its internal queue is drained.
* `diagnostic` Set to boolean `true` to show a yaml diagnostic block
  even if the test passes.  Set to `false` to never show a yaml
  diagnostic block.  (Failing tests show yaml diagnostics by default.)
* `buffered` Set to `true` to run as a buffered [subtest](/subtests/).
  Set to `false` to run as an indented subtest.  The default is
  `false` unless `TAP_BUFFER=1` is set in the environment.
* `jobs` Set to an integer to assign the `t.jobs` property.
* `grep` Set to an array of regular expressions to [filter subtests
  with patterns](/grep/)
* `only` Set to `true` to run this test when in `runOnly` mode.
  See [filtering tests using only](/only/)
* `runOnly` Set to `true` to only run tests with `only:true` set.

### t.todo([name], [options], [function])

Exactly the same as `t.test()`, but adds `todo: true` in the options.

### t.skip([name], [options], [function])

Exactly the same as `t.test()`, but adds `skip: true` in the options.

### t.only([name], [options], [function])

Exactly the same as `t.test()`, but adds `only: true` in the options.

See [filtering tests using only](/only/)

### t.runOnly

Set to `true` to only run child tests that have `only: true` set in
their options (or are run with `t.only()`, which is the same thing).

### t.jobs

If you set the `t.jobs` property to a number greater than 1, then it
will enable [parallel execution](/parallel/) of all of this test's
children.

### t.tearDown(function)

Run the supplied function when `t.end()` is called, or when the `plan`
is met.

Note that when called on the root `tap` export, this also triggers
`autoend` behavior.

### t.beforeEach(function (done) {})

Call the supplied function before every subsequent descendent test.

The `done` callback is a function to call when finished.  You can also
return a [Promise](/promises/) rather than using the `done` callback.

### t.afterEach(function (done) {})

Call the supplied function after every subsequent descendent test.

The `done` callback is a function to call when finished.  You can also
return a [Promise](/promises/) rather than using the `done` callback.

### t.plan(number)

Specify that a given number of tests are going to be run.

This may only be called *before* running any [asserts](/asserts/) or
child tests.

### t.end()

Call when tests are done running.  This is not necessary if `t.plan()`
was used, or if the test function returns a [Promise](/promises/).

If you call `t.end()` explicitly more than once, an error will be
raised.

### t.bailout([reason])

Fire the proverbial ejector seat.

Use this when things are severely broken, and cannot be reasonably
handled.  Immediately terminates the entire test run.

### t.passing()

Return true if everything so far is ok.

Note that all assert methods also return `true` if they pass.

### t.comment(message)

Print the supplied message as a TAP comment.

Note that you can always use `console.error()` for debugging (or
`console.log()` as long as the message doesn't look like TAP formatted
data).

### t.fail(message, extra)

Emit a failing test point.  This method, and `pass()`, are the basic
building blocks of all fancier assertions.

### t.pass(message)

Emit a passing test point.  This method, and `fail()`, are the basic
building blocks of all fancier assertions.

### t.pragma(set)

Sets a `pragma` switch for a set of boolean keys in the argument.

The only pragma currently supported by the TAP parser is `strict`,
which tells the parser to treat non-TAP output as a failure.

Example:

```
var t = require('tap')
console.log('this non-TAP output is ok')
t.pragma({ strict: true })
console.log('but this will cause a failure')
```

### t.threw(error)

When an uncaught exception is raised in the context of a test, then
this method is used to handle the error.  It fails the test, and
prints out appropriate information about the stack, message, current
test, and so on.

Generally, you never need to worry about this directly.

However, this method can also be called explicitly in cases where an
error would be handled by something else (for example, a default
[Promise](/promises/) `.catch(er)` method.)
