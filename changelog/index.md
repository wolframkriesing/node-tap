## 11.0

Significant refactoring and speed improvements.

Add `t.skip()` and `t.todo()` methods.

Add support for [snapshot testing](/snapshots/).

BREAKING CHANGE: classes are actual ECMAScript classes now, so
constructors cannot be called without `new`.

## 10.7 2017-06-24

Add support for [filtering tests using 'only'](/only/).

Don't show grep/only skips in the default reporter output.

## 10.6 2017-06-23

Add support for [filtering tests using regular expressions](/grep/).

## 10.5 2017-06-20

Add support for Maps and Sets in `t.match()`, `t.same()`, and
`t.strictSame()`.

## 10.4 2017-06-18

Add
[`t.rejects()`](/asserts/#trejectspromise--fn-expectederror-message-extra)
assertion.

## 10.3 2017-03-01

* Add `-o` `--output-file` to put the raw TAP to a file.
* Never print Domain objects in YAML.  They're humongous.
* Don't lose error messages in doesNotThrow

## 10.2 2017-02-18

Variety of minor cleanup fixes, and a debug mode.

* Respond to TAP_DEBUG and NODE_DEBUG environs
* Catch errors thrown in teardown handlers
* Improve root-level thrown error reporting
* don't let an occupied test slip past endAll
* Handle unhandledRejection as a root TAP error
* better inspect data
* If results are synthetically set, don't clobber when parser ends
* monkeypatch exit as well as reallyExit

## 10.1 2017-02-07

Added support for source maps.  Stack traces in your jsx and
coffeescript files will now be helpful!

Added the `-J` option to auto-calculate the number of cores on your
system, and run that many parallel jobs.

## 10.0 2017-01-28

Full rewrite to support [parallel tests](/parallel/).  Pass `-j4` on
[the command-line](/cli/) to run 4 test files at once in parallel.

This also refactors a lot of the grimier bits of the codebase, splits
the one mega-Test class into a proper OOP hierarchy, and pulls a bunch
of reusable stuff out into modules.

Somehow, in the process, it also fixed an odd timing bug with
`beforeEach` functions that returned promises.

It truly is a luxury to have a massive pile of tests when it's time to
refactor.

The [mocha-like DSL](/mochalike/) is now much more functional, and
documented.

Now supports passng `-T` or `--timeout=0` to the [CLI](/cli/) to not
impose a timeout on tests.

## 9.0 2017-01-07

Buffered subtests!

This adds support for outputting subtests in the
[buffered](/subtests/) format, where the summary test point _precedes_
the indented subtest output, rather than coming afterwards.

This sets the stage for parallel tests, coming in v10.  Mostly, it's
just an update to [tap-parser](http://npm.im/tap-parser), and a lot of
internal clean-up.

Update [nyc](http://npm.im/nyc) to v10, which includes some fixes for
covering newer JavaScript language features, and support for implicit
function names.

Also: remove a lot of excess noise and repetitive stack traces in yaml
diagnostics.

## 8.0 2016-10-25

Update `tmatch` to version 3.  This makes regular expressions test
against the stringified versions of the test object in all `t.match()`
methods.  It's a breaking change because it can cause tests to pass
that would have failed previously, or vice versa.  However, it is more
expected, and strongly recommended.

Handle unfinished promise-awaiting tests when the process exits.

Show yaml diagnostics for the first "missing test" failure when a plan
is not met, so that the plan can be more easily debugged.
(Diagnostics are still excluded for the additional "missing test"
failures that are generated, to reduce unnecessary noise.)

Make coverage MUCH FASTER by turning on nyc caching.

## 7.1 2016-09-06

Remove a race condition in how `Bail out!` messages got printed when
setting the "bail on failure" option in child tests.  Now, whether
it's a child process or just a nested subtest, it'll always print
`Bail out!` at the failure level, then again at the top level, with
nothing in between.

Support `{ diagnostic: false }` in the options object for failing
tests to suppress yaml diagnostics.

Diagnostics are now shown when a synthetic `timeout` failure is
generated for child test processes that ignore `SIGTERM` and must be
killed with `SIGKILL`.

## 7.0 2016-08-27

Move `# Subtest` commands to the parent level rather than the child
level, more like Perl's `Test2` family of modules.  This is more
readable for humans.

Update to version 2 of the tap parser.  (This adds support for putting
the `# Subtest` commands at the parent level.)

Support use of a `--save` and `--bail` together.  Any test files that
were skipped due to a bailout are considered "not yet passed", and so
get put in the save file.

Forcibly kill any spawned child process tests when the root test
exits the parent process, preventing zombie test processes.

Handle `SIGTERM` signals sent to the main process after the root test
has ended.  This provides more useful output in the cases where the
root test object has explicitly ended or satisfied its plan, but a
timeout still occurs because of pending event loop activity.

Prevent `for..in` loops from iterating inherited keys in many cases,
providing resilience against `Object.prototype` mutations.

Add the `--100` flag to set statements, functions, lines, and branches
to 100% coverage required.

## 6.3 2016-07-30

Let `t.doesNotThrow` take a string as the first argument.

Bump `nyc` up to version 7.

The tap `lib/` folder is excluded from all stack traces.

## 6.2 2016-07-15

Add the `--test-arg=<argument>` option.

## 6.1 2016-07-01

Add support for `{diagnostic: true}` in test and assert options, to
force a YAML diagnostic block after passing child tests and
assertions.

## 6.0 2016-06-30

Only produce output on stdout if the root TAP test object is
interacted with in some way.  Simply doing `require('tap')` no longer
prints out the minimum TAP output, which means that you can interact
with, for example, `var Test = require('tap').Test` without causing
output side effects.

Add `~/.taprc` yaml config file support.

Add the `--dump-config` command line flag to print out the config
options.

Document environment variables used.

Built-in CodeCov.io support has been removed.  If you were relying on
this, you can add `codecov` as a devDependency, and then add this to
the scripts block in your `package.json` file:

    {
      "scripts": {
        "test": "tap test/*.js --coverage",
        "posttest": "tap --coverage-report=lcov | codecov"
      }
    }

## 5.8 2016-06-24

Make coverage piping errors non-fatal.

Clean up argument ordering logic in `t.throws()`.  This now works for
almost any ordering of arguments, which is unfortunately necessary for
historical reasons.  Additionally, you can now pass in an `Error`
class to verify the type, which would previously not work properly in
some cases.

## 5.7 2016-02-22

Report timeout errors in child test scripts much more diligently.

On Unix systems, the child process handles `SIGTERM` signals by
assuming that things are taking too long, dumping a report of all
active handles and requests in process, and exiting in error.

On Windows systems (where `SIGTERM` is always uncatchably fatal), or
if a Unix child test process doesn't exit within 1 second (causing a
fatal `SIGKILL` to be sent), the parent generates more comprehensive
output to indicate that the child test exited due to a timeout.

## 5.6 2016-02-17

Update `tmatch` to version 2.  You can now test objects by supplying
their constructor, so `t.match(x, { foo: Function, name: String })`
would verify that the object has a `name` string and a `foo` method.

## 5.5 2016-02-15

Add the `t.assertAt` and `t.assertStack` properties, to override where
an assertion was effectively called from.

## 5.4 2016-01-31

Support passing in a class to `t.throws`, rather than an Error
sample object.

## 5.3 2016-01-31

Return a `Promise` object from `t.test()`, `t.spawn()`, and
`t.stdin()`.

## 5.2 2016-01-26

Adds `t.beforeEach()` and `t.afterEach()`.

## 5.1 2016-01-16

All about the cli flags!

Support `--node-arg=...` and `--nyc-arg=...` command line flags.

Add support for coverage checking using `--statements=95` etc.

Test for executable-ness more consistently across platforms.

## 5.0 2016-01-03

Make it impossible to `try/catch` out of plan/end abuses.  Calling
`t.end()` more than once, or having a number of tests that doesn't
match the `plan()` number, is always a failure.

Push thrown errors to the front of the action queue.  This means that,
even if other things are pending, an uncaught exception or a plan/end
bug, will always take the highest priority in what gets output.

Many updates to nyc, spawn-wrap, and foreground-child, so that tap now
reliably works on Windows (and a [ci to prove
it](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/isaacs/node-tap).)

Moved into the [tapjs org](https://github.com/tapjs).

## 4.0 2015-12-30

Raise an error if `t.end()` is explicitly called more than once.  This
is a breaking change, because it can cause previously-passing tests to
fail, if they did `t.end()` in multiple places.

Support promises returned by mochalike functions.

## 3.1 2015-12-29

Support sending coverage output to both codecov.io and coveralls.io.

## 3.0 2015-12-29

Upgrade to nyc 5.  This means that `config.nyc.exclude` arrays in
`package.json` now take globs instead of regular expressions.

## 2.3 2015-11-18

Use the name of the function supplied to `t.test(fn)` as the test name
if a string name is not provided.

Better support for sparse arrays.

## 2.2 2015-10-23

Add support for Codecov.io as well as Coveralls.io.

Catch failures that come after an otherwise successful test set.

Fix timing of `t.on('end')` so that event fires *before* the next
child test is started, instead of immediately after it.

`t.throws()` can now be supplied a regexp for the expected Error
message.

## 2.1 2015-10-06

Exit in failure on root test bailout.

Support promises returned by `t.test(fn)` function.

## 2.0 2015-09-27

Update matching behavior using [tmatch](http://npm.im/tmatch).  This
is a breaking change to `t.match`, `t.similar`, `t.has`, etc., but
brings them more in line with what people epirically seem to expect
these functions to do.

Deal with pending handles left open when a child process gets a
`SIGTERM` on timeout.

Remove domains in favor of more reliable and less invasive state and
error-catching bookkeeping.

## 1.4 2015-09-02

Add `t.contains()` alias for `t.match()`.

Use `deeper` for deep object similarity testing.

Treat unfinished tests as failures.

Add support for pragmas in TAP output.

## 1.3 2015-06-23

Bind all Test methods to object.

Add `t.tearDown()`, `t.autoend()`, so that the root export is Just
Another Test Object, which just happens to be piping to stdout.

Support getting an error object in bailout()

## 1.2 2015-05-26

Better support for exit status codes.

## 1.1 2015-05-20

Add coverage using nyc.

If a `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` is provided, then run tests with coverage,
and pipe to coveralls.

## 1.0 2015-05-06

Complete rewrite from 0.x.

Child tests implemented as nested TAP output, similar to Perl's `Test::More`.

## 0.x

The 0.x versions used a "flattened" approach to child tests, which
requires some bookkeeping.

It worked, mostly, but its primary success was inspiring
[tape](http://npm.im/tape) and tap v1 and beyond.
